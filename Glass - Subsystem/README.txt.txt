Glass README:

Glass is one of the subsystems that will be applied in the analytical rule-based CLI CUI chatbot AI, Rusk-Bot.
Glass is the "Help and commands subsystem". It has commands that are to be used. The commands include help commands, which help for knowing which command does what.
To get started, open the .exe file called "Glass", and then type "<cmd:help>". This command will give all the commands that can be used.

Required text files :
"user.txt"
"pass.txt"

[NOTE : 2 commands won't work as their functionality is not coded yet. This is because these commands'  functionality is so large that they will be a subsystem of their own.
The commands are : "<cmd:tutor>" and "<cmd:verbose>".]

This subsystem will receive updates as more functionality is added, such as the commands "<cmd:tutor>" and "<cmd:verbose>".

Write your username in the file user.txt. Write your password for that username with the same index as the username. Make sure to convert the password into the hashed form using encrypter.py.
