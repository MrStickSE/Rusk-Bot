Mice README

Mice is one of the subsystems that will be applied in the analytical rule-based CLI CUI chatbot AI, Rusk-Bot.
Mice is the "Arithmetic Operation Handler Subsystem". The input's flexibility has been drastically improved. Given below is a perfect example of this:

Pre-v1.9 input:

> USER : Add
>> Bot : First number -
> USER : 54
>> Bot : Second number - 
> USER : 79
>> Bot : The sum is = 133

Mice input:

> USER : What is 54+79?
>> Bot : The sum is = 133

It has all been wrapped under one singular input.

Works standalone, no need for any adittional packages, modules, libraries, files, etc.
